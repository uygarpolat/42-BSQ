Python solution for 42 Piscine's BSQ project where you try to find the largest square that can fit in a grid, without intersecting any of the obstacles contained in it.

Usage: `python bsq.py [optional file name]`

Some maps are included as files. If no file name is provided, it defaults to the one given as an example in the project subject. You can also generate your own map by running the included script and copying its contents to a file (`chmod 700 generate_map.sh` may be needed).
